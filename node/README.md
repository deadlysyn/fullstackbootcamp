# node.js

This directory contains node.js exercises from the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

To run these, you'll need [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download).  Then you can simply ```git clone <this_repo>```, install any dependencies via ```npm install``` (if in a directory containing ```package-lock.json```), and finally run ```node <file>.js``` to experience the sheer awesomeness of really really simple academic exercises.  ;-)
