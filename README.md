# Full-Stack Bootcamp

Output from [Colt Steele's full-stack web development course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).
I initially worked through this to brush up on front- and back-end development concepts.  Particularly modern
HTML5, CSS and Javascript. It also has good coverage of building Node.js apps using Express and MongoDB. Aside
from the variety of projects included in the course, you'll be prepared to tackle modern full-stack projects
of your own including thoughtful UX and responsive design concepts.
