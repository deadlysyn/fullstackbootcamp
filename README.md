# Full-Stack Bootcamp

Output from Colt Steele's [full-stack web development bootcamp on udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).
I'm currently working through this to brush back up on front- and back-end development concepts.  Particularly modern
CSS/JS frameworks, Node.js and Express.
